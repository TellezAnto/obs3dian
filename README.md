##  Enable your Digital Brain (or any knowledge base) with Web 3 capabilities.

- Platform Agnostic
- Data Sovereign
- Resilient Content
- Natural Language Searchable
- Transparent Pricing

How can you deploy your knowledge base with Open Source principles?

## CORE CONCEPTS

**Zettelcasten - Markdown files**
**Lit Protocol encrypted**
**Filecoin storage deal for IPFS**
**Fleek edge functions to generate embeddings**
**Galadriel Onchain Agent to process Retrieval**

The dApp takes advantage of blockchain technology to store encrypted data in an decentralized manner, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the information. Users will be able to access their notes and documents from any device with an internet connection.

## MVP
Use crypto signatures to encrypt and decrypt files. Via Filecoin or IPFS Publish encrypted files to decentralized storage,

### *Suggested Workflow:*

1. Connect your wallet to the dAPP
2. Upload or create
3. Work on your files and push to encrypt and publish to IPFS

## Next Steps / Work In Progress

# Publish / Deploy
Use open source tools to build JS Web App and access from browsers
## Browser Extension
This bit can handle decryption and display of MD from browser


# Galadriel Onchain Agent
Embeddings from Knowledge Base to stored on IPFS and queried for retrieval by Galadriel Oracle
