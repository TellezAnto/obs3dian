Fleek could serve as a decentralized alternative to centralized platforms like Obsidian by leveraging its Web 3 capabilities. Fleek offers seamless integration with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage, ensuring that your notes and files are distributed across the network, enhancing security and availability. Additionally, Fleek can utilize blockchain technologies for immutable data records, ensuring the integrity and provenance of your content. By integrating smart contracts, users could automate sharing permissions and collaborations directly on the blockchain, enabling a transparent and trustless environment for team projects. Moreover, Fleek's support for decentralized identity management can provide secure authentication and personalized access controls without relying on traditional centralized systems, thus aligning with the ethos of Web 3.
